  <h1>History of Islam in the West and Africa</h1>

  <h2>Islam in West Africa</h2>
  <p>
    Islam began spreading in West Africa around the 8th century through trade and the influence of Muslim merchants from North Africa. Major empires such as the Mali, Ghana, and Songhai adopted Islam, and cities like Timbuktu became centers of Islamic learning. Sufi brotherhoods also played a significant role in spreading Islamic teachings and establishing schools and mosques across the region.
  </p>

  <h2>Islam in the West</h2>
  <p>
    In Western countries, Islam grew significantly in the 20th century due to immigration, conversion, and global connectivity. Large Muslim communities now exist in Europe and North America. Many Western Muslims are active in religious, cultural, and political life, contributing to the diversity and development of their societies.
